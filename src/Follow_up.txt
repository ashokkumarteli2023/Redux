npx create-react-app reduxhook
npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

added bootstrap in 'index.html'
Component folder-> 'Navbar.js'(isme right hand side me balance show hota h) and 'Shop.js'
State folder-> 
    Action-creators folder(parents)->
        'actionCreators.js' (actions are deposit and withdraw money)
        'index.js' (to comine all actionCreators)
    Reducers folder(Ashok)->
        'amountReducer.js' (it takes state and action and return new state)
        'index.js' (to combine all the reducers)
    'store.js' (Creating a Redux store with middleware)

Next step is to wrap 'index.js' to {provide the Redux store to the application}
